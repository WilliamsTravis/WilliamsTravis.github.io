  At SIU my focus was on alternate farming practices for corn and soy production. I worked as a research assistant while I worked 
  on a family ranch farther south. I started out in the fields applying fertilizer and other 
  treatments, taking soil samples, and analysing them in the lab. When the research team realized that I could use GIS systems I 
  my main task shifted and began making maps for several papers.

    Unfortunately, I can't find any of the earlier maps, but I do have plenty from the last study that I was most involved in. I was 
    given full reigns for this one, wrote most of the material, performed most of the analysis, and made all of the maps and figures.
    It involved cover cropping and no-till practices as part of a broader examination into alternate farming practices in light of 
    severe agricultural run-off flowing out of the mid-west. If we could show that yields respond positively to nitrogen fixing cover 
    crops, and that no-till practices are no less productive than traditional tilling, an argument for less fertilizer use and runoff
    generating tillage practice could have been made. 
    It was a split-plot treatment design with several types of cover crops that sometimes combined with the no-till treatments and it
    ran for two years in 2014 and 2015.

    The results might have been more straightforward, but when I mapped the resulting yield patterns we noticed the results above. The 
    2014 growing season was particurly dry and only plants in troughs of the site produced significant yields. The next year was 
    particularly wet and only the plants in the trough did poorly. The yields in both years followed the topography so strongly it 
    was difficult to mete out a treatment effect. <i>Also,</i> the design was not made with topography in mind and we lacked no-till
    treatments in the site's main trough. We went ahead and made an attempt to account for the topography in the analysis, but no one
    was prepared for such a task. I moved to Colorado and the PI moved to North Carolina and we never found the time to tackle the 
    revisions, but we came away with a decent lessen: consider topography when designing agricultural treatment blocks!
