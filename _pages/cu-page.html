<h3>Experiments with drought index-based insurance</h3>
   <p style="font-size:11px">For work at Earth Lab and for my thesis, I was asked to see what weather-based index insurance would look 
     like with a drought index. So, using the structure of a USDA rainfall index insurance program called "Pasture, Rangeland, and
     Forage", I did that using 11 different drought indices. I will post the thesis and related articles when they are published and 
     they will describe the process and results in detail, but for now here are some of the graphics that came out of the project along 
     with brief descriptions.</p>

<h4 id="prfadoption">Pasture, Rangeland, and Forage Adoption and Loss Ratios</h4>
          <p style="font-size:11px">The program started in 2007 as a pilot, and payments were based on either a rainfall or NDVI-based 
          vegetation index. The vegetation was dropped in 2015 before the program went national, but I wasn't entirely sure why. So, 
          using Risk Mangement Agency business reports, I created these maps showing participation and yearly loss ratios for each index.
          It turns out that the vegetation index loss ratios vacillated wildy, going as low as 0.04 in 2010 (not displayed) and as high
          as 2.35 in 2012 and 2013. Maybe there were other reasons they dropped it, but this alone would be cause enough. This was made
          entirely in R with ggplot.</p>

<h4 id="palmerquirks">Quirky Palmer Drought Severity Results</h4>

<p style="font-size:11px">The Palmer drought severity indices showed strange seasonality, it lines up well with the 98th meridian and 
  the USFS ecoregions. The data for this map was generated with numpy arrays in Python, and rendered in ggplot in R.</p>

<h4 id="usdmprf">Comparing the Rainfall Insurance to the US Drought Monitor</h4>
<p style="font-size:11px">As a side project, I was asked to calculate the frequency that the PRF insurance program does not pay a 
    policyholder when the US Drought Monitor says that there's drought. To answer this I developed a tool that allows the user to 
    select a level of rainfall deficit that would trigger payouts in the PRF and compare that with the frequency of a chosen level 
    of drought severity according to the USDM. This is done is Plotly's new DASH platform, using mapbox to overlay scatterplots of 
    Numpy arrays on an zoomable map.</p>
