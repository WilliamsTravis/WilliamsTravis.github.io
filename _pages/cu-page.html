  At CU Boulder my focus has been on climate risk management, particularly as it concerns drought and the cattle ranching industry in 
  the US. The course work for this program was split between more conceptual geography, spatial statistics, and programming applications
  for GIS. Here, I'll try to select some of the more interesting results, and see if I can't briefly explain them.

<h2 id="thesis-work">Experiments with drought index-based insurance</h2>
<p style="font-size:14px; text-align:justify">
     For my thesis and work at the research group I work for, I was asked to demonstrate what weather-based index insurance would look 
     like with a drought index. I searched and found that every mention of drought index insurance was actually referring to a rainfall 
     index-based plan. So, using the structure of an existing rainfall index insurance program called "Pasture, Rangeland, and
     Forage" (PRF), I made some alterations and created an experimental plan designed to fit 11 different drought indices. I will post 
     the thesis and related articles when they are published and they will describe the process in detail, but for now here are some of
     the graphics that came out of the project.

<h3 id="insurance-adoption">Pasture, Rangeland, and Forage Adoption and Loss Ratios</h3>
<img align="center" src="/images/prf_adoption.png" alt="Pasture,Rangeland,Forage policies 2007 - 2017">
<p style="font-size:14px; text-align:justify">
     The PRF program started in 2007 as a pilot, and payments were based on either a rainfall or 
     NDVI-based vegetation index. The vegetation was dropped in 2015 before the program went national, but I wasn't entirely sure 
     why. So, using Risk Mangement Agency business reports, I created these maps showing participation and yearly loss ratios for 
     both indices. It turns out that the vegetation index loss ratios vacillated wildy, going as low as 0.04 in 2010 (not 
     displayed) and as high as 2.35 in 2012 and 2013. Maybe there were other reasons they dropped it, but this alone would be
     cause enough. These were made entirely in R with ggplot.

<h3 id="palmer-quirks">Odd Palmer Drought Severity Index Results</h3>
<img src="/images/Ecoregion_PDIS_PCF.png">
<p style="font-size:14px; text-align:justify">
  One of the concerns of the rainfall index is that it often pays more in the winter and fall than in the
  growing season. To see if drought indices might incentivize growing seaosn selection, I mapped the months when each would pay the 
  most according to payment calculation factor (PCF) trends since 1948. The PCF is a measure of the amount of money an index would 
  trigger in the structure of the PRF. The Palmer drought severity indices showed strange seasonality, it lines up well with the
  98th meridian and the USFS ecoregions. The data for this map was generated with numpy arrays in Python, and rendered in ggplot in R.

<h3 id="usdm-prf">Comparing the Rainfall Insurance to the US Drought Monitor</h3>

<p style="font-size:14px; text-align:justify">
  As a side project, I was asked to calculate the likelihood that the PRF insurance program would not pay when 
  the US Drought Monitor says that there's drought. To do this I developed a tool that allows the user to select a level of rainfall
  deficit that would trigger payouts in the PRF and see generate a map of the conditional probability of experiencing both a chosen 
  level of drought severity according to the US Drought Monitor and not receiving a payout. This is done via Plotly's new DASH platform,
  using mapbox to overlay scatterplots of Numpy arrays on an zoomable map. It is served on an EC2 Ubuntu machine through Amazon Web 
  Services. Data was retrieved from the Climate Prediction Center of NOAA and The National Drought Mitigation Center at the University
  of Nebraska-Lincoln.
