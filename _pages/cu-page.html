  At CU Boulder my focus has been on climate risk management, particularly as it concerns drought and the cattle ranching industry in 
  the US. The course work for this program was split between more conceptual geography, spatial statistics, and programming applications
  for GIS. Here, I'll try to select some of the more interesting results, and see if I can't briefly explain them.

<h2 id="thesis-work-insurance">Thesis Work: Drought Index-Based Insurance</h2>
<p style="font-size:14px; text-align:justify">
     For my thesis and work at the research group I work for, I was asked to demonstrate what weather-based index insurance would look 
     like with a drought index. I searched and found that every mention of drought index insurance was actually referring to a rainfall 
     index-based plan. So, using the structure of an existing rainfall index insurance program called "Pasture, Rangeland, and
     Forage" (PRF), I made some alterations and created an experimental plan designed to fit 11 different drought indices. I will post 
     the thesis and related articles when they are published and they will describe the process in detail, but for now here are some of
     the graphics that came out of the project.

<p style="font-size:14px; text-align:justify">
     The PRF program started in 2007 as a pilot, and payments were based on either a rainfall or 
     NDVI-based vegetation index. The vegetation index was dropped in 2015 before the program went national, but I wasn't entirely sure 
     why. So, using Risk Mangement Agency business reports, I created these maps showing participation and yearly loss ratios for 
     both indices. It turns out that the vegetation index loss ratios vacillated wildy, going as low as 0.04 in 2010 (not 
     displayed) and as high as 2.35 in 2012 and 2013. Maybe there were other reasons they dropped it, but this alone would be
     cause enough. These were made entirely in R with ggplot.

<h3 id="texas-example">Experimental Drought Index Example</h3>
<img align="center" src="/images/TX_PDSISC_80.png">
<p style="font-size:14px; text-align:justify">
  This is an example of payouts from one of the experimental drought index insurance plans: the Self-Calibrating Palmer Drought Severity
  Index. This graph shows the somewhat random nature of rainfall-based payouts, a grouping pattern of payouts that arise from drought 
  indices with a longer "climate memory", and the seasonality of payouts between each. In this example, the total amount of potential 
  payouts are roughly equal.

<h3 id="palmer-quirks">Odd Palmer Drought Severity Index Results</h3>
<img src="/images/palmer-quirks.png">
<p style="font-size:14px; text-align:justify">
  One of the concerns of the rainfall index is that it often pays more in the winter and fall than in the
  growing season. To see if drought indices might incentivize growing seaosn selection, I mapped the months when each would pay the 
  most according to payment calculation factor (PCF) trends since 1948. The PCF is a measure of the amount of money an index would 
  trigger in the structure of the PRF. The Palmer drought severity indices showed strange seasonality, it lines up well with the
  98th meridian and the USFS ecoregions. The data for this map was generated with numpy arrays in Python, and rendered in ggplot in R.

<h3 id="usdm-prf">Comparing the Rainfall Insurance to the US Drought Monitor</h3>

<p style="font-size:14px; text-align:justify">
  As a side project, I was asked to calculate the likelihood that the PRF insurance program would not pay when 
  the US Drought Monitor says that there's drought. To do this I developed a tool that allows the user to select a level of rainfall
  deficit that would trigger payouts in the PRF and generate a map of the conditional probability of experiencing both a chosen 
  level of drought severity according to the US Drought Monitor and not receiving a payout. This is done via Plotly's new DASH platform,
  using mapbox to overlay scatterplots of Numpy arrays on an zoomable map. It is served on an EC2 Ubuntu machine through Amazon Web 
  Services. Data was retrieved from the Climate Prediction Center of NOAA and The National Drought Mitigation Center at the University
  of Nebraska-Lincoln. More explanation can be found in the application.

<h3 id="altind-prf">Drought Index Insurance Laboratory</h3>

<p style="font-size:14px; text-align:justify">
  This is the result of the PRF with alterations for each drought index, expressed as potential outputs across the US and over time. 
  I'll let you read the in-app description for an idea of how it works. I still have some tinkering to do; I'd like to more precisely 
  scale the actuarial rates and better tailor the experimental program for each location. However, it is still useful to get an idea 
  of the general differences in the patterns of payouts between rainfall and drought index-based plans. It also has some nifty secret
  features, try pressing control when you click on the map. This was made in a similar fashion as the app above. Data was retrieved 
  from the Risk Management Agency of the USDA, the Climate Prediction Center of NOAA, and the Westwide Drought Tracker via the Desert 
  Research Institute's web-site.

<h2 id="thesis-work-market">Thesis Work: Climate Signal in Market Data</h2>
<p style="font-size:14px; text-align:justify">
    Another chapter in my thesis was an econometric analysis of drought impacts in the climate market. It used the same weather indices
    above to try and quantify the impacts of drought on cattle weights at live-cattle auctions. This was a two-way fixed effects panel
    model that used two years of seasonal climate values (averaged within a 500km radius around each auction) and average price to 
    predict cattle weightsacross a 140 site sample in the central US. This is another project that will be explained in more detail 
    when the papers are published, but some of the findings were interesting enough to glance at here.

<h3 id="local-residuals">Market Model Local Residuals</h3>
<p style="font-size:14px; text-align:justify">
    The model was ran for each of the twelve indices (including the rainfall graph) and growing season effects were consistently 
    significant, it explained almost 80% of the total variance, and each model was surprisingly similar. The model wasn't as 
    good in the northern auctions where strong seasonality in market weights made the predictions unreliable, despite an attempt to 
    correct for that. This is my first fixed-effects model, though, so I am pleased with the results. These are the residual structures
    from just the rainfall index model, they were all surprisingly similar so this one is representative.
