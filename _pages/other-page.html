  A friend in Pope County, IL has a small farm and wanted a map of contour lines for reference, so I found lidar data through 
  the Illinois Geospatial Data Clearing House and used ArcMap to create this DEM and contours. He didn't need any of the traditional
  map elements, but I really like how this turned out.
