Hello and welcome to my  online portfolio! Over  the last five years I have  been working as a research assistant either as a  master's 
student at the University of Colorado in  Boulder or on contract with Southern Illinois University in Carbondale. Along the  way I have
developed some skill at various mapping applications and data manipulation. So, to help you see what I can do, I have compiled a sample 
of research outputs  here. This is a collection of graphics, maps mostly, that I have developed for work  and class projects.  Above, I 
have  organized the  collection by  employer and  have also included my resume, just  in case. Some of these projects,  just  like this 
website, are a work in progress. I am always looking to improve and would love feedback so let me know what you think!
