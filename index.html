<p> Hello and welcome to my online portfolio. I am a geographer who focuses on climate risks in agriculture.
Over the last five years I have  been working as a research assistant either as a  master's 
student at the University of Colorado in  Boulder or on contract with Southern Illinois University in Carbondale. Along the way I have
developed some skill at various mapping applications, data manipulation, and research. On this site, I have compiled a sample 
of maps, graphics, and interactive research support tools, such as the example below.
