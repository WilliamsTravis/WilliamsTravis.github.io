<h1> About Me </h1>
<p> I am a recent graduate with a major focus on climate risks in agriculture and an enthusiasm for puzzling geospatial projects. 
I and am currently working as a research associte at the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmnetal Sciences in Boulder,
Colorado where we study decision making and water scarcity. Over the last five years I have been working in research either as a
master's student at the University of Colorado or on contract with Southern Illinois University in Carbondale. In addition to research,
I have experience with a variety of GIS applications, statistical programs, and scripting languages. On this site, I have compiled a
sample of maps, graphics, and interactive research support tools to demonstrate my abilities. These are currently organized by the
the organization I was working for when I made them.

<p> I believe this portal is a good representation of my current abilities, so I am including it on the front page. Because
  I work closely with drought indices, and because there is a large variety of these, I thought it would be useful to develop a way 
  to display them in one place for general comaprisons. This tool allows the user to compare spatial and temporal patterns of various
  drought indices over the Contiguous United States. With it, they can select four different maps representing different values to be
  displayed side-by-side, adjust the time period for each, generate a time series for any location, and adjust the color gradients on
  the fly. The data was acquired from the <a href="https://wrcc.dri.edu/wwdt/" target="_blank">Westwide Drought Tracker</a> and the
  <a href="https://governmentshutdown.noaa.gov/" target="_blank"> NOAA Physical Sciences Division </a>. I'll be adding more indices to
  the list of options as time goes by. This was created in Python using Plotly's new DASH platform and served via NGINX and Green
  Unicorn on a Digital Ocean Droplet. Here is the
