<h1> About Me </h1>
<p style="text-align:justify "> I am a recent graduate from the University of Colorado where I focused on climate risks in agriculture
and geospatial modeling. I am currently working as a research associate at the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences in Boulder,
Colorado where we study decision making and water scarcity. Over the last five years I have been working in research either as a
master's student at the University of Colorado or on contract with Southern Illinois University in Carbondale. In addition to research,
I have experience with a variety of GIS applications, statistical programs, and scripting languages. On this site, I have compiled a
sample of maps, graphics, and interactive research support tools (such as the one below) to demonstrate my abilities. These are
currently ordered by the organization I was working for when I made them.

<p style="text-align:justify "> I believe this portal is a good representation of my current abilities, so I am including it on the front page. Because
  I work closely with drought indices, and because there is a large variety of these, I thought it would be useful to develop a way 
  to display them in one place for general comaprisons. This tool allows the user to compare spatial and temporal patterns of various
  indices over the Contiguous United States. With it, they can select two different maps to be
  displayed side-by-side, adjust the time period for each, generate a time series for any location (by clicking on the map), and adjust the color gradients on
  the fly. The data was acquired from the <a href="https://wrcc.dri.edu/wwdt/" target="_blank">Westwide Drought Tracker</a> and the
  <a href="https://governmentshutdown.noaa.gov/" target="_blank"> NOAA Physical Sciences Division</a>. I'll be adding more indices to
  the list of options as time goes by. This was created in Python using Plotly's new DASH platform and served via NGINX and Green
  Unicorn on a Digital Ocean Droplet. Here is the
