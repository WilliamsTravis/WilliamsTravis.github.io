<p style="text-align:justify"> Hello and welcome to my online portfolio! Over the last five years I have been working as a research 
    assistant either as a master's student at the University of Colorado in Boulder or on contract with Southern Illinois University in 
    Carbondale. Along the way I have developed some skill at various mapping applications and data manipulation. So, to help you see what 
    I can do, I have compiled a sample of research outputs here. This is a collection of graphics, maps mostly, that I have developed for
    work and class projects.
      Above, I have organized the collection by employer and have also included my resume, just in case. Some of these projects, just like
    this website, are a work in progress. I am always looking to improve and would love feedback so let me know what you think!
