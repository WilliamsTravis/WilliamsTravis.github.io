<h1> About Me </h1>
<p> I am a geographer who focuses on climate risks in agriculture and am currently working
as a research associte at the Cooperative Institute for Environmental Research in Boulder, Colorado. Over the last five
years I have been working in research either as a master's student at the University of Colorado or on
contract with Southern Illinois University in Carbondale. In addition to research, I have experience with a variety of
GIS applications, statistical programs, and scripting languages. On this site, I have compiled a sample of maps, graphics, and
interactive research support tools to demonstrate my abilities.

  <a href="https://governmentshutdown.noaa.gov/" target="_blank"> NOAA Physical Sciences Division </a>. This was created in Python using
  Plotly's new DASH platform and served via NGINX and Green Unicorn on a Digital Ocean Droplet.</P> Here is the
