  <h3>From geographer with focus on climate risk management, data analytics, and programming problem solving</h3>

     <p style="text-align:justify"> Hello and welcome to my online portfolio! Over the last two years I have been working as a research assistant, teaching assistant, and student at the University of Colorado in
    Boulder. I am receiving a Master's in Geography focusing on climate risk management and weather-based index insurance for agriculture
    in particular. Prior to this position, I worked as a research assistant at Southern Illinois University in the Ag department where we 
    studied strategies to reduce fertilizer runoff. Along the way I have developed some skill at various mapping applications and data
    manipulation. So, to help you see what I can do, I have compiled a sample of research outputs here. This is a collection of graphics,
    maps mostly, that I have developed for either research or class projects.
      Above, I have organized the collection by employer and have also included my resume, just in case. Some of these projects, just like
    this website, are a work in progress. I am looking to improve and would love feedback so let me know what you think!</p>
