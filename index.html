<p>Hello and welcome to my  online portfolio! I am currently a master's student of geography who focuses on climate risks in agriculture.
Over the last five years I have  been working as a research assistant either as a  master's 
student at the University of Colorado in  Boulder or on contract with Southern Illinois University in Carbondale. Along the way I have
developed some skill at various mapping applications and data manipulation. So, to help you see what I can do, I have compiled a sample 
of research outputs  here. This is a collection of graphics, maps mostly, that I have developed for work and class projects. Some of these
projects, just like this website, are a work in progress and so I will be continuously updating the content.</p>
