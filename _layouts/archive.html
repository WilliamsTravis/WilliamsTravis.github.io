  <p> For the last two years I have been working as a research assistant, teaching assistant, and student at the University of Colorado in \
    Boulder. I am receiving a Master's in Geography, and along the way I have picked up quite a variety of mapping skills. To help you see
    what I can do I decided to put together this portfolio! This is a collection of maps, mostly, that I have made as a research assistant 
    either here at CU or at Southern Illinois University where I used to work as a research assistant in the Agriculture department.</p>
